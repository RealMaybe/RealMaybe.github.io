# Contribution Guide 🐾

Welcome to RealMaybe's little corner!

Although this is a personal project independently maintained by me, I warmly welcome your suggestions, ideas, and bug reports.  
Every piece of feedback you provide is an important force in making this website even better 💖

[中文文档](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
[English Document](./CONTRIBUTING.en.md)

However, to maintain consistency and stability, we currently **do not accept code-related Pull Requests**.  
But don't worry — whether it's a wording improvement, a bug hint, or a design inspiration,  
as long as you've contributed to this little site, I will carefully record it and include it in the [Acknowledgments page](https://www.realmaybe0429.space/thanks) ✨

## 🛑 Code Contributions Not Accepted

To maintain project consistency and long-term maintainability, we currently do not accept the following types of Pull Requests:

-   Code modifications such as new features or component refactoring
-   Mandatory dependency upgrades or architectural changes (unless with very strong justification)

📝 Note: All code changes will be evaluated and implemented by me personally. If you have technical suggestions, feel free to discuss them in an Issue first — I read every single one carefully.

## 🙏 Every Contribution Will Be Remembered

Every valid contribution, no matter how small, will be recorded at:

This is not a cold "sponsor list", but a **growth diary** —  
documenting how this little site evolved from a solo idea into something gently cared for by many people 🌱

Every suggestion, every bug report, every spark of inspiration — will leave its mark here.

This is my way of saying “thank you”, and the warmest part of this little site ❤️
